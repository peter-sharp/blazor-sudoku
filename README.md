# Sudoku
This is a simple Sudoku game made using the .net Blazor framework. The goal is the get a simple sudoku game up and running, then expand from there; learning as much as we can on the way. 

## Roadmap
-[x] Load level data from json file
-[x] render level as hml table
-[ ] Only show some numbers and have inputs for the hidden numbers
-[ ] Add victory conditions
-[ ] Add level generator. Which will either replace json levels, or supplement them
-[ ] Host this on Azure or something else.

## Roadblocks
- Page loads but throws  "Unhandled exception rendering component: Object reference not set to an instance of an object." on line 19
